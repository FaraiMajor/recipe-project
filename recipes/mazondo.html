                    <hr>
                    <p>Sometimes I wonder why people came to eat the different things that we all eat. I like to imagine that it was perhaps a mother who had nothing to feed her children that day and decided to try mopani worms. Or it was perhaps the quest
                        not to throw anything away, that made my people realise you could eat cow feet if you cooked them for a long time. Mazondo also known as cow foot in English is a Zimbabwean delicacy that will leave you craving for more. It is cooked
                        slowly untill the feet are tender before adding more ingedients to elevate the flavors even more.

                        <li>In a large pot, place the cow foot and pour about 4litres of beef stock (you can use any stock cubes to create stock) then add salt.</li>
                        <li>Place pot on medium heat and cook for 2-3hours until the cow foot is soft on touching and the skin is slightly separating from the bone then place aside.</li>
                        <li>In a small pan. Place the tablespoon of oil and fry the onions, once the onions are soft, add the tomatoes, madras, paprika and pepper and cook until it has turned into a thick sauce.</li>
                        <li> Pour the sauce in the cow foot and mix well , return to cooker and cook for a further 30mins to an hour.</li>
                        <li> Once cooked, the cow foot skin should be almost falling off the bone and the gravy should be thick.</li>
