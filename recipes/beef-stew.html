                    <hr>
                    <p>Beef stew is amongst one of the very common meals in Zimbabwe. It’s the typical relish found at most dinner tables across the majority of Zimbabwean society. When you hear people saying Sadza nenyama (pap with meat) in most cases they
                        are referring to sadza and beef stew. Despite the fact that nyama (meat) is a broad term which can be used to any meat and not just beef. Beef stew is also common at many Zimbabwean gatherings such as weddings and funerals. Perhaps
                        this is because this is one of the relatively less complicated dishes to make.

                    <hr>
                    <ol>
                        <li>With your ingredients ready which are 600g super blade beef, 1/4 onion chopped, 1 tomato,4 tbsp oil for frying,2 tbsp soup powder,1 ltr water and 1/2 tsp salt cut your beef into good sized pieces. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a medium sized
                            pot and add your beef to it.</li>
                        <li>Add salt and fry your beef until it has browned up. Add water (1 ltr) and partly cover your pot. You may either slow cook your beef or cook it on high heat it’s really up to you.</li>
                        <li>When your meat is tender, drain excess water which is now beef stock into a separate jug (do not discard) and set-aside. Add 2 tbsp of oil to the meat in the pot. Add onions and fry until they are cooked (2min). Add tomatoes and
                            stir until they are also just about cooked (2min). Whilst the tomatoes are cooking, take your set-aside beef stock and mix it with your 2 tbsp soup powder. Pour the mixture into the beef. Cover the pot and simmer for 5min so
                            that everything is well combined and flavors mix together. If you feel the soup is too thick for your liking you may add some more water.</li>
                        <li>Your beef stew is ready to serve. Enjoy with sadza, rice, potatoes, spaghetti or anything you wish.</li>
