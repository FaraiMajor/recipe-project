Sadza
It is a star food for the people of the country, essential for them. It is a kind of bread prepared with corn flour. The mixture is molded with the hands to form balls. They can be cooked alone or with peanut butter, one of the most-used products in the region. They are usually accompanied by beef stew and covo. Covo is a type of vegetable which resembles chard and is cooked with onion, garlic, and peanut butter.
